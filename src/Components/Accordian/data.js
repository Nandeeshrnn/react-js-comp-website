     ques:'2. What is the difference between virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)?',
     ans : 'Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in a completely digital environment, often using VR headsets that cover the eyes and ears, creating an experience of being in a different world. Augmented Reality (AR), on the other hand, overlays digital information on the real world through devices like smartphones or AR glasses. While VR creates a completely new environment, AR enhances the real world with digital elements.'

     ques:'4. What is blockchain technology and how does it work?',
     ans : 'Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers. This ensures that the transaction history is secure, transparent, and immutable. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, and these blocks are linked together in a chain. It is primarily known for its role in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend to various industries including supply chain management, healthcare, and finance.'
